			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<p>When I first decided I wanted to know more about understanding and writing code I thought that I could learn one language well then be able to build anything I wanted to with ease. I've come to find out that there is a lot more that goes into coding than just knowing how to assign variables and using a loop effectively. I also never realized just how much code and time goes into just creating a basic website or application.</p>

				<p>The more I learn about writing code and being a developer the more I feel I have to learn to be as proficient as I hope to be. I enjoy a challenge and I get great satisfaction from even the small accomplishments I have achieved. There are also frustrations (often many) between these accomplishments but I see each set back as an opportunity to learn something new or a new approach that I would have never thought of if I hadn't run into a problem.</p>

				<p>When I first started working with query parameters, I just didn't get it. No matter what articles I tried to read, tutorials I completed, or videos I watched I just couldn't understand them in a way that made sense to me. Looking back now it seems like I was just trying to over complicate them. I use them now without any problems and feel much more confident in my code because I took the time to focus on them and probably learned more about them because they were a frustration.</p>

				<p>I've learned that coding is very rewarding for me. I love the feeling of getting a feature to work as well as the journey towards a finished product. The ups greatly out number the downs so far in my code journey. I look forward to continuing to learn every chance I get and building all kinds of applications.</p>
