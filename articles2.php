				<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
				
				<p>The World Wide Web allows millions of people around the world to connect. Some people use it to be creative while others use it to connect with others socially. You can even use the web to get a degree with online classes. With this vast collection of knowledge, potentially everyone in the world can benifit from the internet.</p>

				<p>The web is made up of numerous computers working together to make the connections needed to pass packets of information to each other until the information reaches it's final destination. In order for the web to work there must be computers that are always availible to help pass data along so that users can recieve the information they requested. These computers are called servers. Servers work with the rest of the computers connected to the internet to determine which data packets need to be sent and where. Without all the connections made by these computers, the web would not be nearly as accessible or even availible.</p>

				<p>When you request a webpage or sometimes even certian applications to load, the device that you are using sends your request to a server. Your request might even be sent to multiple servers until the request reaches the server containing the webpage or application you asked for. The server containing the requested information then separates the data into several packets so that they can be moved faster and sends them back the same way your request was sent. Once the data packets reach your device, they are reasembled and then presented to you just like you asked(as long as everything goes according to plan).</p>

				<p>The internet has become a big part of our lives. Since so many people use it everyday I wonder what the future will look like as it becomes more and more relient on the internet. Will everyone have access to the internet one day? Will there ever be a way to eliminate cyber crime and other malicious use of the internet? As a developer I look forward to shaping the future of the web and how it's used to benifit the world we live in. I hope that I can help the web become even more useful and work with others to make it more approachable for future generations.</p>
