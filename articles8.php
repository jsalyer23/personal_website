			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<p>The last couple weeks we have started to work on projects with others in a group. It has been interesting to see how my perspective is sometimes different from the other people in my group. I think that it has been helpful to plan out a project with others because it requires all of us to be more specific about planning. It's also easier to work on an application when you know specifically which part you are responsible for.</p>

				<p>I have chosen to focus on back-end development rather than the front-end. I feel that one day I would like to be proficient at both but the logic behind the scenes is very intriguing to me. We have recently been introduced to Object Oriented Programming. At first I wasn't sure where to start. Creating instances of objects and being able to call methods on them reminded me a lot of Arrays. The more I tried rebuilding my Pokedex project with OOP in mind, the more I feel I understand the concept.</p>

				<p>I rebuilt our entire Pokedex application in PHP to help me keep another progamming language fresh in my mind. While I was rebuilding the PHP version I realized that things that use to take me 30 minutes or more to accomplish were being written in only a few minutes. I've become better and better with writing my tests for my functions and doing so before I even try to use them in whatever it is I am building.</p>

				<p>These last couple weeks have been different than all the weeks before but I have enjoyed these weeks the most. I look forward to the new projects to come and the new experiences that will come with them. I'm becoming more confident in my code with every finished assignment.</p>
